# Random Chord Player 

Made for ear practice picking out notes from chords. Currently only supports triads.
Commands:
- p: plays a random chord (Major, Minor, Augmented, Diminished) in a random inversion (root, first, second) and prompts the user to pick out the bottom, middle, or top note.
- r: replays the last played chord
- a: prints the identity of the chord and plays the note prompted by the last "p" command.
